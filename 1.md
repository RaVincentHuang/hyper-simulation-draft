目前的尝试：
1. 转超图->暂时保持
2. semantic cluster
    逻辑：
        点点 get_nli_labels_batch
        点边 
        边边 Similarity Score
        闭包
    达到的效果：最后的结果能够固定下来，但其实效果也不是特别好
    **问题**：没法在simulation里面测试（超图不太一致）
3. 收紧：
    get_hyper_simulation:
        [0] EcoTech -> A technology company, function, The goal, a new software, to analyze
        [1] developed -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, is, data, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
        [2] an AI application -> -
        [3] an AI application -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, a new software, to analyze
        [4] analyzes -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
        [5] consumption patterns -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
        [6] to optimize -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, is, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
        [7] power usage -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, to analyze
        --------------------------------
        result: {5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, 4: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12}, 2: set(), 3: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12}, 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, 1: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, 0: {0, 4, 8, 11, 12}}
    只要entailment：特别少
        get_hyper_simulation:
            [0] EcoTech -> -
            [1] developed -> has created, energy consumption
            [2] an AI application -> -
            [3] an AI application -> artificial intelligence
            [4] analyzes -> -
            [5] consumption patterns -> utilizes, users
            [6] to optimize -> -
            [7] power usage -> energy consumption
            result: {6: set(), 5: {2, 7}, 0: set(), 3: {3}, 7: {10}, 4: set(), 2: set(), 1: {1, 10}}
    收紧domain的阈值：
        最初的目的：判断两者在语义类型上是否兼容
            POS/ENT在同一个范围即可
        三种尝试
            1. 对于ENT缩进，要求ENT的type以及POS_SAME
            get_hyper_simulation:
                [0] EcoTech -> -
                [1] developed -> has created, utilizes, energy consumption, to analyze
                [2] an AI application -> -
                [3] an AI application -> artificial intelligence, a new software
                [4] analyzes -> has created, utilizes, to analyze
                [5] consumption patterns -> A technology company, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [6] to optimize -> has created, utilizes, to analyze
                [7] power usage -> A technology company, function, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, to analyze
            POS_RANGE: 这里其实就多了个动词
            get_hyper_simulation:
                [0] EcoTech -> -
                [1] developed -> has created, utilizes, is, energy consumption, to analyze
                [2] an AI application -> -
                [3] an AI application -> A technology company, artificial intelligence, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, a new software, to analyze
                [4] analyzes -> has created, utilizes, to analyze
                [5] consumption patterns -> A technology company, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [6] to optimize -> has created, utilizes, is, to analyze
                [7] power usage -> A technology company, function, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, to analyze
            2. 把POS_range换成tag_range
            get_hyper_simulation:
                [0] EcoTech -> -
                [1] developed -> has created, utilizes, is, energy consumption, to analyze
                [2] an AI application -> -
                [3] an AI application -> artificial intelligence
                [4] analyzes -> has created, utilizes, to analyze
                [5] consumption patterns -> A technology company, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [6] to optimize -> has created, utilizes, is, to analyze
                [7] power usage -> A technology company, function, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, to analyze
                --------------------------------
                result: {3: {3}, 4: {1, 2, 12}, 6: {1, 2, 12, 5}, 5: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}, 1: {1, 2, 5, 10, 12}, 2: set(), 7: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12}, 0: set()}
            3. 在原来基础上换掉：tag_range
            get_hyper_simulation:
                [0] EcoTech -> A technology company, function, The goal, a new software, to analyze
                [1] developed -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, is, data, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [2] an AI application -> -
                [3] an AI application -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, a new software, to analyze
                [4] analyzes -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [5] consumption patterns -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [6] to optimize -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, artificial intelligence, function, is, data, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, a new software, to analyze
                [7] power usage -> A technology company, has created, utilizes, function, users, The goal, the optimization, energy consumption, to analyze
        保底：在最后加一层向量相似度的判断
        **问题**：
            1. 感觉其实效果都差不多，如果要缩进可以直接从is_domain入手，没有一个金标准？
            2. 如果用向量做最后一轮的话感觉还是没有规避掉相似度这个点，不过肯定是能筛掉一部分不一致的情况了

最后退一步：开除节点

# 1. NLI->NER(ent->pos)->word_net
# 2. 句子提一级，用word_net（名词类、形容词、AUX、动词（不动））

4. 一致性“是和否”的标准？
    主要也就是看3的结果了，可以最后就只判断“不一致”，不判断“一致”，低于****为不一致即可


Related Work: 
1. 向量数据库的哪个角度入手？
2. 大体内容：写各个主流向量数据库（milvus/pinecone等等）做的优化？
3. 最终目的：要突出向量数据库还没有数据质量管理的模块？

1. 系统
2. 数据可用性：可用性
